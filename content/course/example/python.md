## Think about it...

“Now we all know what the most important meal of the day is…. Breakfast right? Now picture this. You have one bowlful left of your favorite cereal. You pour it into the bowl and check the date on your milk. You have 2 days before it expires, great! As you pour in the milk, you see some chunks fall into your cereal… That is a little concerning so you give the bowl and milk a whiff… GROSS. The milk is definitely spoiled even though the date says otherwise. Now, not only are you wasting food but you lost that last bowl of your favorite cereal. Not only is this disappointing because your breakfast is ruined but it is a waste of food. If you had known your milk was bad beforehand, you would probably use more prior. In addition, it is a waste of cereal. It could have been anything, a whole box of mac and cheese, a cake, cookies, anything you put milk in. I don't know about you, but that would ruin my day. But wait, how can we prevent this from happening you may ask? Fresh Assure. If you had had a Fresh Assure lid, you would have been able to check that the milk was spoilt and you would not have wasted that last bowl.”

“Have you ever wondered if the expiration date on your milk is accurate? FreshAssure has made smart lids that give consumers more confidence in the freshness of their milk in a sustainable way that also reduces food waste.”
