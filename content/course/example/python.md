## Think about it...

{{< figure src="milk.jpg" >}}

Now we all know what the most important meal of the day is…. Breakfast right? Now picture this. You have one bowlful left of your favorite cereal. You pour it into the bowl and check the date on your milk. You have 2 days before it expires, great! As you pour in the milk, you see some chunks fall into your cereal… That is a little concerning so you give the bowl and milk a whiff… GROSS. The milk is definitely spoiled even though the date says otherwise. Now, not only are you wasting food but you lost that last bowl of your favorite cereal. Not only is this disappointing because your breakfast is ruined but it is a waste of food. If you had known your milk was bad beforehand, you would probably use more prior. In addition, it is a waste of cereal. It could have been anything, a whole box of mac and cheese, a cake, cookies, anything you put milk in. I don't know about you, but that would ruin my day. But wait, how can we prevent this from happening you may ask? Check Fresh! If you had had a Check Fresh device, you would have been able to check that the milk was spoilt and you would not have wasted that last bowl.
